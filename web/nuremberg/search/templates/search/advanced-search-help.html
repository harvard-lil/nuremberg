    Most advanced queries can be made naturally. For example, to find English-language documents about
    Erhard Milch relating to treatment of workers in 1944, search for:
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="example-search" id="example-search-0">workers Erhard Milch english 1944</span>
    <a href="{% search_url 'workers Milch english 1944' %}" aria-labelledby="example-search-0">Search</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    By default, documents that contain all keywords in any field are
    found. Our data can sometimes be incomplete, so you should usually try a more general
    search first. The filtering options shown on the left will let you narrow down the results.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, you can also define specific fields to use for keyword search.
    For example, to restrict your search to documents written by Milch, search for:
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="example-search" id="example-search-1">workers english 1944 author:Milch</span>
    <a href="{% search_url 'workers english 1944 author:Milch' %}" aria-labelledby="example-search-1">Search</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    Or to include documents used in Milch's prosecution, but written by someone else, you can exclude a field using the minus sign:
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="example-search" id="example-search-2">workers english 1944 defendant:milch -author:milch</span>
    <a href="{% search_url 'workers english 1944 defendant:milch -author:milch' %}" aria-labelledby="example-search-2">Search</a>
  <p>
    You can search for any number of exact phrase matches in or out of a field
    by quoting the phrase to be searched, such as:
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="example-search" id="example-search-3">"international law"</span>
    <a href="{% search_url '"international law"' %}" aria-labelledby="example-search-3">Search</a>
  <p>
    The same field can be searched multiple times in a query, and you can use parentheses to search for multiple keywords in a field. These are equivalent:
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="example-search" id="example-search-4">date:january date:1937</span>
    <a href="{% search_url 'date:january date:1937' %}" aria-labelledby="example-search-4">Search</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="example-search" id="example-search-5">date:(january 1937)</span>
    <a href="{% search_url 'date:(january 1937)' %}" aria-labelledby="example-search-5">Search</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    By default, all field queries must match. You can use the OR operator <strong>|</strong> within a field to search for documents that contain either keyword:
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="example-search" id="example-search-6">author:himmler author:speer|buch</span>
    <a href="{% search_url 'author:himmler author:speer|buch' %}" aria-labelledby="example-search-6">Search</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    For many fields, we have incomplete data, and you can specify only documents without a field
    using the special keyword "unknown" or "none":
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="example-search" id="example-search-7">workers date:unknown</span>
    <a href="{% search_url 'workers date:unknown' %}" aria-labelledby="example-search-7">Search</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="example-search" id="example-search-8">instructions trial:none</span>
    <a href="{% search_url 'instructions trial:none' %}" aria-labelledby="example-search-8">Search</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span class="example-search" id="example-search-9">experiments date:1944|unknown</span>
    <a href="{% search_url 'experiments date:1944|unknown' %}" aria-labelledby="example-search-9">Search</a>
  </p>
  <p>
